# Instructions

- Must follow PEP 8 style guide
- Ensure code has proper logging and error handling. All errors, potential issues and key progress steps should be logged.
- Keep functions short and focused. Give them meaningful names.
- Ensure there is enough info, warning, error and debug mode logging in the code. When debug mode is on, one should be able to follow code flow by looking at the logs.
- Always commit and push after every meaningful change with meaningful commit messages

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than *right* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
