## Project Overview

This project builds a trading copilot / assistant whose primary role is to improve trading decisions by surfacing risk, context, and inconsistencies, not by predicting prices or generating trading signals.

The system acts as a second set of eyes — quietly reviewing a proposed trade and highlighting what the trader may have overlooked.



### The assistant is:

- Risk-first
- Process-oriented
- Non-predictive
- Explainable
- Trader-specific over time

### What This Project Is NOT
- The assistant must never:
- Predict price direction
- Claim high-probability outcomes
- Generate buy/sell signals
- Replace trader judgment
- Optimize for win rate alone
- This is not a signal service, alpha engine, or automated trading system.

### Core Product Philosophy

“Slow the trader down, not tell them what to do.”

### The assistant exists to:

- Improve decision quality
- Reduce preventable mistakes
- Encourage discipline and consistency
- Surface contextual risk
- Build long-term trader trust
