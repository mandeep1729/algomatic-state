<current_state>
In `/gsd:new-project` flow, at research phase. PROJECT.md and config.json are committed. Research agents were spawned but hit rate limits. Only PITFALLS.md completed successfully.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- PROJECT.md created and committed (synthesized from docs/PRD.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/STORIES.md)
- config.json created and committed:
  - mode: yolo (auto-approve)
  - depth: standard (5-8 phases, 3-5 plans each)
  - parallelization: enabled
- User emphasized: comprehensive testing, modular design with small reusable components
- research/PITFALLS.md completed (26 pitfalls documented)

</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

Research phase (3 of 4 remaining):
- STACK.md - Not started (agent hit rate limit)
- FEATURES.md - Not started (agent hit rate limit)
- ARCHITECTURE.md - Not started (agent hit rate limit)
- SUMMARY.md - Not started (needs other 3 first)

After research:
- Define requirements (Phase 7 of new-project)
- Create roadmap (Phase 8 of new-project)
- Initialize STATE.md

</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- User chose to research despite having detailed docs (PRD, ARCHITECTURE, STORIES)
- Stack: Python 3.11+, PyTorch, alpaca-py, pandas/numpy, scikit-learn
- Testing: Comprehensive coverage required (beyond 80% core)
- Architecture: Modular design with small, single-responsibility components
- Execution: YOLO mode, parallel plan execution

</decisions_made>

<blockers>

- Rate limits on research agents - will reset, just need to wait and resume

</blockers>

<context>
Building "Algomatic State" - a momentum trading system with AI-learned market state representation. The user has extensive existing documentation in docs/ folder (PRD.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, STORIES.md) that defines the system clearly. They want:

1. Data pipeline: Load 1-minute OHLCV from CSV and Alpaca API
2. Feature engineering: Returns, volatility, volume, market structure features
3. State representation: Temporal windows → normalization → PCA/autoencoder → regime clustering
4. Strategy: Baseline momentum filtered by favorable regimes, pattern matching, dynamic sizing
5. Backtesting: Event-driven engine with walk-forward validation
6. Execution: Alpaca paper/live trading with risk controls

Core value: State representation improves momentum strategy by identifying favorable market conditions.

Target: Sharpe > 1.0, max drawdown < 15%, win rate > 50%

<next_action>
Resume with: `/gsd:resume-work`

This will:
1. Spawn remaining 3 research agents (STACK.md, FEATURES.md, ARCHITECTURE.md)
2. Synthesize into SUMMARY.md
3. Continue to requirements definition
4. Create roadmap
5. Complete project initialization
</next_action>
